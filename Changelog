My reasons for building oxygen-rom were twofold. First, this lightweight Gingerbread rom still supports the HTC Desire completely, no problems with FM-radio, Camera, Wifi hotspot or anything like that. Second, by now many security flaws in Gingerbread have been found and not addressed. I wanted to close as many of these security holes as possible. I reckon that any app on Google Play might use something like Gingerbreak or ZergRush for some nefarious purpose, so these holes should be closed. Then there was the Master Key vulnerability which was pretty bad. And all those "external" apps in the Android repo, which have not been updated but are still part of Android, such as openssel and dbus. I must say that I find it hard to gauge the impact in the latter category.

By no means have I checked all external packages for security flaws. However, this rom at least doesn't some of the most glaring issues in other Gingerbread roms.

Note that I have swapped the traditional a2sd script for int2ext+, which means that you have to to a factory reset if you're upgrading from previous versions of oxygen-rom.

Thanks to the writers of all those patches that I used.
